# ludusavi-generator

## Description

This script adds two new options to the Ludusavi section in the game menu.

`Create .ludusavi.yaml for the selected game` generates a .ludusavi.yaml file in the selected game's installation directory for Ludusavi to use for backup and save game management. It is specifically designed for games that are not included in PCGamingWiki.

`Add a new save path to the existing .ludusavi.yaml` adds additional save path such as config or screenshot.
